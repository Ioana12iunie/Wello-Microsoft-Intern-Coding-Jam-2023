Wello is a mental wellness app that takes in your habits and preferences, and uses artificial intelligence to create a schedule tailored to maximize your productivity and mental wellbeing.

## Getting Started

Here are the steps for installation:

* Ensure you have the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed.
* Clone this Github repository to your local machine with ```git clone https://github.com/Ioana12iunie/Wello.git```
* Open the cloned repository with Android Studio, and build & run the project.

In the future, we hope to get a functional version of Wello deployable for the Google Play Store.

## Features

The Wello App...

Using the Wello App requires user registration. The user can log in with an existing account, or create an account upon using the app.

On the home screen, users are greeted with several options:

* **Create a plan:** Users can create a plan for themselves, based on factors they would like to implement, such as a sleep schedule, designated time for exercise, and designated time for meditation. Based on these factors, an LLM will take in all of these inputs and generate a schedule and overall plan for the day. This chatbot feature will make it easy for the user to be able to give feedback and adjust their schedule accordingly.

* **Viewing the plan:** Users can see the generated output at any time by using this feature to stick with their goals. In the future, we hope to implement a checklist to do away with the tasks one by one, and hope to integrate an "export to calendar" feature so users can add their schedule to their calendars and get notifications to stay on track.

* **Updating goals:** Sometimes, we need to take a time out and restructure our day based on unexpected events. With this feature, users can change their current plans and goals to reflect their new needs for the day.
